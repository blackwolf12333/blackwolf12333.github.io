			<h1>Quotes from Out of the software crisis</h1>
			<p>I've been reading <a href="https://softwarecrisis.baldurbjarnason.com/">Out of the Software Crisis by Baldur Bjarnason</a>, and I thought I'd collect some quotes from the book that spoke to me here.</p>

			<blockquote><p>Skipping tests to save time is akin to setting a good portion of your budget on fire. Unit tests and types have a business purpose.</p></blockquote>

			<blockquote><p>It’s popular today to believe that ‘good’ in books, film, music, or
design is entirely subjective. It isn’t. Quality is relative, but it isn’t sub‐
jective.</p></blockquote>

			<blockquote> It may sound ridiculous. But checklists (and similar abstractions) work. They are one of the most basic forms of system feedback available, but they absolutely do work. They save people’s lives before and after surgery. They prevent planes from crashing, and factories from exploding. They are good stuff</blockquote>

			<blockquote>Skipping tests to save time is akin to setting a good portion of your budget on fire. Unit tests and types have a business purpose.</blockquote>

			<blockquote>The business purpose of unit tests and types isn’t to prevent defects but to prevent variations in quality. Unexpected improvements in quality are just as undesirable as discovering a bug.</blockquote>
			<blockquote>This suggests that we cannot maximize information generation by
maximizing the success rate of a test. We maximize information con‐
tent of the test by approaching a 50 per cent failure rate. Our testing
processes need to have an adequate failure rate to generate sufficient in‐
formation.</blockquote>

			<blockquote>The most effective way to counteract the pop culture tendencies of
both design and programming is research. This is a big reason why the
programmers on a team should participate in the research process</blockquote>

			<blockquote><p>Most programmers are about as aware of their own the‐

ory-building as the proverbial fish is of water. It’s like breathing, they
don’t have to be aware. It’s just how it works.</p><cite>p. 76-77</cite></blockquote>
			<blockquote><p>Every version of ‘agile’ is promoted by people who genuinely be‐
lieve they have solved the problem of software quality. They are all
wrong because the problem isn’t with the process.</p><cite>p. 87</cite></blockquote>

			<blockquote><p> We throw
two half-baked unfinished designs into a functional shipping applica‐
tion that people rely on to do their work and use Data™ to see which un‐
mitigated disaster is marginally less disastrous for the working lives of
those held hostage by our applications. We gaslight our customers as a
standard practice and think we’re doing them a favour.</p><cite>p. 89</cite></blockquote>
			<blockquote><p>What helps us is that despite the endless number of frameworks,
there are only a few controlling paradigms in web development, and
you only need to grasp the three most common.</p><cite>p. 124</cite></blockquote>
