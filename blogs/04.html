			<h1>Understanding MySQL deadlock logs</h1>
			<p>Recently I became interested in understanding deadlock errors
			in the application at my {{dayjob}}. To get a better understanding
			you first need some data of what transactions actually deadlock. In
			order to do this I configured our database servers to log all deadlocks
			to the mysql error log. See <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_print_all_deadlocks">innodb_print_all_deadlocks</a>.</p>

			<p>I can't show you the actual logs that I'm getting from our application
			but what I can do is expand on the excellent <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/innodb-deadlock-example.html">mysql deadlock example</a> from the
			official documentation (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241214192732/https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/innodb-deadlock-example.html">archive.org</a>).</p>

			<p>I'll pick out a couple of important lines from the error log example and expand
			on the explanation why this caused a deadlock. The first line I want to talk about is: </br>
			<ul>
						<li>Transaction 1: <code>RECORD LOCKS space id 28 page no 4 n bits 72 index PRIMARY of table `test`.`Birds` trx id 43260 lock mode S locks rec but not gap</code></li>
						<li>Transaction 1: <code>RECORD LOCKS space id 27 page no 4 n bits 72 index PRIMARY of table `test`.`Animals` trx id 43260 lock_mode X locks rec but not gap waiting</code></li>
						<li>Transaction 2: <code>RECORD LOCKS space id 27 page no 4 n bits 72 index PRIMARY of table `test`.`Animals` trx id 43261 lock mode S locks rec but not gap</code></li>
						<li>Transaction 2: <code>RECORD LOCKS space id 28 page no 4 n bits 72 index PRIMARY of table `test`.`Birds` trx id 43261 lock_mode X locks rec but not gap waiting</code></li>
			</ul>
			
			</br>
			We'll see 4 similar looking lines like this one in the error log, each with a slight variation. I want to highlight
			a couple of important bits:

			<ul>
						<li><code>lock mode S locks rec but not gap</code>: This tells us that this transaction has acquired a shared lock</li>
						<li><code>index PRIMARY of table `test`.`Birds`</code>: This tells us that this transaction is locking the PRIMARY index of the Birds table</li>
			</ul>

			The second line has some variations on this:

			<ul>
						<li><code>lock_mode X locks rec but not gap waiting</code>: This tells us that this transaction is waiting to acquire an exclusive lock</li>
						<li><code>index PRIMARY of table `test`.`Animals`</code>: This tells us that this transaction is waiting to lock the PRIMARY index of the Animals table</li>
			</ul>

			As we can see in the lines of Transaction 2, the inverse is happening. Transaction 2 is waiting for an exclusive lock
			on Birds, and currently holds a shared lock on Animals. And this is the cause of the deadlock, neither transaction can
			finish without the other giving up it's exclusive lock.
			</p>

			<p>
			One final detail is that we can actually tell which physical records are the cause of the deadlock. The error logs
			also describe which exact records are being locked. You can find out which by looking at the lines that look like 
			<code>Record lock, heap no 2 PHYSICAL RECORD: n_fields 4; compact format; info bits 0</code>.</br>
			The important bit here is the <code>heap no 2</code>, this tells us that we are locking record 2. It's not entirely
			clear to me what this 2 refers to, it's not the actual id of the row. In the example in the mysql docs this 
			isn't really that interesting, all locks point to the same heap no 2. But I've found that in our production logs
			there are often more records locked and then you can determine using this number after heap no which exact records
			are causing your deadlock.
